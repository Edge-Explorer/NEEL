# NEEL Backend: AI Intelligence Engine 🧠⚙️

The NEEL Backend is a high-availability FastAPI service that orchestrates the project's **Multi-Agent Intelligence System** and handles secure data persistence.

## 🤖 AI Agent Architecture

NEEL doesn't use a single prompt. It uses a cascading chain of agents to ensure high-fidelity coaching:

1.  **Supervisor Agent**: Analyzes the current user profile and activity logs. Decides if there is enough data to generate "High-Level Intelligence" or if the user needs more "Onboarding Guidance."
2.  **Reasoning Agent**: The core strategist. It looks at historical summaries, conversational context (permanent memory), and current goals to generate a draft response.
3.  **Reflection Agent**: The Auditor. It reviews the Reasoning Agent's draft for tone, safety, and goal alignment. It can reject, soften, or approve the advice.

## 📡 API Endpoints

### 🔐 Authentication (`/api/auth`)
- `POST /register`: User registration.
- `POST /login`: JWT token generation.

### 📊 Dashboard (`/api/dashboard`)
- `GET /`: Returns a unified payload including profile, recent activities, activity breakdown, and onboarding progress.

### 🧠 Intelligence (`/api/intelligence`)
- `POST /analyze`: The main chat interface. Processes queries, manages conversational context, and handles **[AUTO_LOG]** and **[UPDATE_PROFILE]** magic tags.
- `GET /history`: Fetches the user's permanent chat history.

### 👟 Activities (`/api/activities`)
- `POST /log`: Manual activity logging.
- `PUT /log/{id}`: Update logs (24-hour window enforced).
- `DELETE /log/{id}`: Delete logs (24-hour window enforced).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **FastAPI**: Asynchronous Python microframework.
- **LangChain**: AI orchestration and prompt management.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization.
- **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**: State-of-the-art LLM.

## 🗄️ Database Schema
The database maintains the following primary entities:
- `User`: Identity and credentials.
- `UserProfile`: Goals, focus areas, and settings.
- `ActivityLog`: Detailed records of time spent.
- `ChatMessage`: Persistent record of all user/AI interactions.
- `AnalyticsSummary`: Periodic "memories" generated by the AI.
