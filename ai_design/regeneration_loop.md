# Regeneration Loop — NEEL

The regeneration loop allows NEEL to correct itself
instead of blocking responses unnecessarily.

Flow:
LLM → Reflection → Regeneration → User

Key principles:
- Constraint-driven rewriting
- No new advice introduced
- Confidence-aware tone adjustment

This completes NEEL’s closed-loop intelligence system.
